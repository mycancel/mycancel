## Currently Coding

[Array-Method-A-Day Sandbox](https://github.com/mycancel/array-method-a-day)

Challenging myself to explore array methods by using an array method a day. The application will be deployed to Github Pages with the intention to dynamically display information and an example of the array method on the page.

[Code Quiz](https://github.com/mycancel/code-quiz)

Polishing and refactoring my least favorite coding project of the UNC Bootcamp. At the time, I did not understand the basics of updating HTML with JavaScript or, simply, how to make an array of objects. Now, this project does not seem as daunting. I hope to make this application into a project that I can be proud of. With fresh perspective and a better understanding of dynamically updating HTML and CSS with JavaScript, my goals include:

 - Creating an easy to update question array and quiz key
 - Condensing and refactoring code so that there is no unnecessary or duplicate code (*cough* Event Listeners *cough*)
 - Changing filler information to relevant technical interview questions to practice
 - Adding mobile-first CSS styling

## Look Out For

A Card Game MERN stack project

I am in the process of deciding whether to use MongoDB for the cards or call in a third-party API, but this project will be the first big project after my graduation from the UNC Charlotte Bootcamp. 

The inspiration from this project comes from my long-time interest in video games. As an avid digital Sudoku and Solitaire player, I want to create a card game that will eventually lead to a larger game. In order to not show my cards just yet, I want to start small with a game of Blackjack.

I will see how far the MERN stack takes me within this project, and I may look into other programming languages in the future to polish it.
